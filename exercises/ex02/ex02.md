# Exercise 2
## Pointers


1.  Read `stack.c`, which should be in this directory.  What is it
intended to do?  What would the output be if the program worked as
expected?
*- First look: It looks like it is supposed to create an array of length 5 with every value being 42, then return it. It also runs bar, which does some calculation and then does nothing with the results. Finally, the main prints it again.*

2.  Compile it.  Do you get a warning?  What does it mean?
*- I got a warning saying that foo returned a pointer to a local variable. I guess that's the problem.*

3.  Run it.  What happens?  You might get a segmentation fault, or you might get
some strange output.  Can you explain it?  You might find it
helpful to draw a stack diagram.
*- I got a segfault. I can explain it. The function foo creates an array in the stack that the array points to. Once you leave foo, that function's stuff goes away. In main, the new pointer doesn't point to the array we created.*

4.  Comment out the `print` statements in `foo()` and `bar()` and run
it again.  What happens now?
*- They were already commented out. It has the same segfault either way.*

5.  Add comments to the code to explain these experiments and the results,
then check the code in to the repo.
*- Done.*

Moral: Don't return pointers to stack allocated data!
