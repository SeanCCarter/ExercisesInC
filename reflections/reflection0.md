##Sprint Reflection

####Combining goals
Our team mostly had the same interests in the exercise in which we moved around the room. While we were at the same signs, we discussed what about that area interested us in particular, and what sort of projects we could imagine doing. We noticed that we all valued topics that connected the architecture of our computers and the high level programs that we were used to running. This is how we chose making a shell as our best option to investigate further, since it seems like an integral part of what is needed to make a computing environment functional.

####Dividing Tasks
We chose Joey as our scrum master, since he is the most focused on the class, and because he was the one who made the Trello board. So far, there has been very little division of responsibility in the actual tasks being carried out. A lot of the things that we are doing early on in the class are important for all of us to do - we all did separate research on topics to pick possible goals, and we all need to do the same exercises to make sure that we are up to speed with C and the basic functions of an OS.

####Sprint backlog
Our sprint backlog is currently pretty simple. It has some of the basic things that we want to do in this project, but not fully fleshed out. I think that our future work with the sprint backlog will be to use the research that we are doing now to break those cards into more concrete goals. For now, our sprint tasks are just the things we want done for the next few meetings.

####Apprehension
I am very worried about the lack of scaffolding in the class. I know that Olin enjoys having free range engineering majors, but we know almost nothing about this subject area, which means that we can't yet effectively decide what is most important for us to learn, or even what will interest us the most. I think our intense searching of other colleges course pages for project guidance suggests that we might need some more help there.
