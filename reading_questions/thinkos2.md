## Chapter 2


### Processes

1) Give a real-world example of virtualization (ideally not one of the ones in the book).
*In the power grid, power can be drawn from any nearby source, like power plants or renewables. At your end, it might as well come from the socket.*

2) What is the difference between a program and a process?
*A program is a piece of code, that performs a function, while a process is a program, that program's data, and any necessary metadata.

3) What is the primary purpose of the process abstraction?  What illusion does the process abstraction create?
*It makes it look like the process is running alone, continuously, on its own computer. This is important, because it keeps different processes isolated, and allows you to run hundreds without hardware collisions - processes don't need to know anything about other processes.*

4) What is the kernel?
*It is a core part of the operating system responsible for creating threads, among other things.*

5) What is a daemon?
*It is a process that runs in the background to provide operating system services.*
